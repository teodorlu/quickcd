** Where's the hardest point?
I believe in [[https://play.teod.eu/enter-the-forest-at-its-darkest-point/][entering the forest at its darkest point]].
What does this mean?

1. I've wrappped fzf from babashka before
   1. https://github.com/teodorlu/neil-quickadd
   2. https://github.com/teodorlu/browsetxt
2. I've never written a shell wrapper for a script that enables access to the parent shell.

A simple approach: eval each line without checking anything.
A less simple approach: have some keyword / line prefix that signifies that this line should be evaluated.

Potential problem: will the shell wrapper break fzf integration?
How will that even work?
Does fzf use STDOUT or STDERR?
